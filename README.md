This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native when working with AsyncStorage: accessing data before it's fully loaded. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version using async/await or promises to handle asynchronous operations properly.  The error results in undefined or null values being returned from AsyncStorage when a value is expected.
